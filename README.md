# Dynamic-Quiz

Project for the JavaScript study guide: [How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/)

The application is a simple web with several quizzes, organized in tabs, and allows users to log in and out (though it is very primitive).

Each quiz has radio button choices with questions pulled from a json file. The user can go back and forth between questions and change the choice picked, as well as know its score upon completion, independently for each tab.

The quizzes can be added dynamically to the application given a json file. Each quiz and tab is created using a template (Handlebars.js).
